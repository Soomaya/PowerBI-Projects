## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive **Accounts Payable Overview** for finance departments.  
It enables users to monitor invoice payments, analyze supplier performance, and anticipate upcoming liabilities — offering a 360° view of the company’s payables across local and foreign vendors.

## Objectives
- Track the **total payable amounts** and identify overdue or upcoming invoices.  
- Visualize the **distribution of payables** by currency (MAD, EUR, USD).  
- Compare **vendor exposure** and detect top outstanding balances.  
- Enhance **cash flow forecasting** through detailed invoice aging analysis.  
- Facilitate **decision-making** for finance managers and accountants.
